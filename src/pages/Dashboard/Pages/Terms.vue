                    <p>We provide clearly accessible free samples of each BizMiner report series on our site. The samples are for a generic industry, but the metrics and measures displayed 
                        for each report series are identical to those displayed in every report within that series, regardless of the industry or area selected. We do not provide individual
                        company lists or information in any report series except where specifically stated in the free sample. Where there is a reasonable question as to
                        the accuracy of statistics we present, we will make a reasonable effort to check the underlying data and assure that we have reported or manipulated it accurately.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>When you purchase an online report, you will be taken to an account page which has been established for you. You can access your reports from that page by selecting 
                        the corresponding icons. In addition, we will send you an email with login information for unlimited future access to your reports. We will utilize the email that
                        you input prior to your transaction. It is your responsibility to input a valid email address, and to set your spam controls so that you can receive the information

                        is lacking from the database. Not all information received is uniform or complete, resulting in the need to develop projection algorithms

                        to the Licensee or any Authorized User or anyone else for any loss or injury caused in whole or part by its negligence or compilation, 
                        interpretation, reporting or delivering the IMR or Lists or information contained in them. In no event will Licensor be liable to the 
                        Licensee or any Authorized User or anyone else for any decision <br> <br> 
                        made or action taken by the Licensee or any Authorized User or anyone else in reliance on information contained in the Reports, or for 
                        direct, consequential, special or similar damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The Licensee agrees that the liability 
                        of Licensor, if any, arising out of any kind of legal claim (whether in contract, tort, negligence or otherwise), in any connected with the 
                        service or the information in the service, shall not exceed the amount the licensee paid to Licensor for use of the License.</p>

                    <h6 class="md-subheading">General</h6>
                    <br>
                    <p>This Agreement contains the final and entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee and supersedes other verbal or written negotiations,
                        understandings or agreements, until such time as modifications or amendments to the Agreement are mutually agreed to in writing and 
                        signed by the authorized representatives of both parties. The terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement override all online 
                        "click-through" agreements, any "click-wrap" agreements, any automatic update agreements, and any other agreement, of whatever kind,
                        whereby users of the Software purport to enter into or accept contractual terms or conditions that are different from, or in addition 
                        to, this Agreement. Both parties' rights and obligations of this Agreement are not assignable without prior written consent of the other
                        party, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. <br> <br> This Agreement is enforceable only against and by the parties who have
                        executed it; the Agreement neither creates nor restricts rights in third parties. Further, if any provision of the Agreement provides 
                        that Licensee shall enforce the terms of this Agreement against third parties, or restricts the legal rights of third parties, such 
                        provision shall be void. <br> <br> If any provision of this Agreement is invalid under applicable law, the remaining provisions will 
                        continue in full force and effect. <br> <br> Security: You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Subscriber username 
                        and password. You are responsible for activity and charges incurred by any persons using your username and password to log into your account.
                        If you feel that your username and password has been compromised, it is your responsibility to change the username and password on your account
                        immediately and contact Bizminer regarding any perceived unauthorized use. <br> <br> Assignment and Venue: Your rights and obligations under
                        this Agreement are not assignable. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue
                        in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and 
                        any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The parties
                        agree that Licensee, by agreeing to venue and jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, is not waiving its sovereign immunity or other Eleventh Amendment
                        rights. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

                    <h6 class="md-subheading">Valuation Toolkit and Vestimates</h6>
                    <br>
                    <p>You should not use Vestimates® or other tools in the Bizminer Valuation Toolkit in place of a valuation. Bizminer does not suggest using
                        Vestimates® or the Toolkit as the basis of any specific business-related or other financial transaction. You should not attempt to use 
                        a Vestimate® or other Valuation Toolkit elements to secure a business or personal loan. Our data sources may be incomplete or incorrect; nor <br> <br> 
                        have we physically researched or inspected many important details necessary to the valuation of a specific enterprise. Neither the Vestimate® 
                        nor other Valuation Toolkit tools consider the market environment details nor the idiosyncrasies of a firm’s performance that can influence 
                        the actual value or selling price. <br> <br> We encourage business buyers, sellers, owners and browsers to enhance their understanding of the 
                        value of any enterprise before making decisions or taking action. The Vestimate® and other Valuation Toolkit elements are modeled informational
                        tools, not guides to action. For that we recommend obtaining an appraisal from a business broker, a valuation from a certified valuation professional, 
                        or both.</p>
